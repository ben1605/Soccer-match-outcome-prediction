### Objective

Our object is to predict the outcome of European soccer matches from 2008 to 2016 given the detailed match information which includes both teams’ player info, betting odds from different providers, etc.

### Data set

We used three data sets. The first one contains more than 25,000 European soccer matches and their information from 2008 to 2016, such as scores, lineup players’ id, team formation and events. The second file consists of the betting odds for each match. The last one has all players and teams attributes from EA Sports FIFA games. We believe that FIFA gives relatively accurate ratings for players since it puts a lot of efforts into estimating players’ abilities. It uses a network of over 9,000 members to do a throughout review on each player.
